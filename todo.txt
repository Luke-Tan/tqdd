Need a new way to get names from companies

Best bet is to find the name from the copyright logo...

1) fetch webpage
2) Compile list of texts : <div>, <span>, 
3) find the element that contains Â© , (c) , copyright etc
4) look for the elements before and after it (this should give us a total of 3 text elements)
5) eliminate all numbers
6) eliminate copyright logo/ copyright
7) pray to god we get the name (maybe do a fuzzy match with the domain?)
8) lol
