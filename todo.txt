whois: domain only (no http://, no subdomain, no www)
logos: full domain (subdomain, http, no www)
text: full domain (no subdomain, http, www)

SOME NEED WWW, SOME DONT, IT DEPENDS ON THE WEBSITE ITSELF


	
THINGS TO DO ATM (Currently breaking the app):		Notes
1. Get ALL links from the initial webpage			NOT WORKING WITH THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK, NEED TO USE CHEERIO TO SCRAPE		Done!!
2. Loop through these links and return data 		Promises may be tricky
3. Logos seem to be the biggest problem now			Whois, wordcloud should be no problem and unaffected

need to restructure the way logos are presented

if 1 logo in pic => 
if >1 logo in pic =>

filter logos by confidence => <0.18 

necessary to crop images in the long run

MAKE THE APP ROBUST!!! => Try for a LOT more websites

WWW issue is still pressing, must look for a solution
