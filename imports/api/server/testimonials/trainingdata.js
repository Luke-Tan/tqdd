`I am very pleased with PKWA Family Law. My matter was handled very well. It was stress free & the fees were fixed, which gave me a lot of comfort. From the first free consultation, I could see that PKWA Law has an enormous amount of experience and ethics. I first saw Mr Lim and Ms Chow They guided me and were very professional and knowledgeable. What I especially like is that they told me what I could get and could not get. When I wanted to take a certain approach, Mr Lim told me not to spend money unnecessary as he felt I won’t succeed. He was very frank and honest and it is refreshing to see that he charged a much lower fee instead of charging a higher fee to fight an impossible case. The commitment of the lawyers and support staff to my case was outstanding.`,

I had heard about his achievements and when I engaged him, I was not disappointed. When I was fighting the divorce case, It is clear to me that he and his team of divorce lawyers are divorce specialists and very well versed in family law. They were very responsive, and knew their stuff well. Everything was done professionally. Thanks to him and his team, I got what I wanted. I found the fees to be clear and affordable.`,
`Hi Chong Boon, How are you? I still can recall the day when I first came to see you with my brother in your office. That time, I was lost and helpless, had gone to seek legal aid, enquired with HDB, communicated to Developer, went to seek advice from MP, but I was still lost, with no direction, no knowledge on how to move on, or where to get an answer… All in all, it took me about 3 months or so to bring myself to walk into PKWA office, but to me, it seemed very long for me to live each day in that 3 months. I have confidence in your advice, though I hesitated using you due to the lawyer fees. However, I’m glad that all has been sorted out with regard to the divorce. Thanks a lot, Chong Boon. Please take care. Madam K, 20 June 2016`,
`Dear Mr Lim, I have recently received the judgment from the Family Courts for my divorce case. Finally!! From a seemingly hopeless scenario when I first turned up at PKWA Law, it is a ruling that is truly way, way beyond what I could expect, or even dared dream! Not only does this conclusion to my 3-year long tedious divorce process bring huge relief, this Court ruling has also very much restored my faith in the Singapore judicial system as well. I can truly & positively testify that PKWA Law is certainly one of the best, if not the best, legal firms here and will not hesitate to highly recommend it to anybody in need.`,

More importantly, Telesales Services provided us with quality firms that would represent us well.”`,
`“One of our clients—a large manufacturer of medical devices–had a specialized inbound [call center outsourcing] need that required licensed nurses to take calls. I wasn’t sure how to locate a  Call Center that could meet our specialized Health Care needs.   I found that Telesales Services was able to provide the best fit thanks to their large network of  Excellent Health Care Call Centers and  extensive experience  with medical providers. Telesales Services saved me considerable time in my search and were a pleasure to work with.”`,
`“In my Google search, I located a lot of telemarketing firms and talked with several.  Most were unable to help me as they dealt only with large corporations and immense budgets and projects.  I then discovered Telesales Services and talked directly to Mary Jo, the President who explained her company’s unique role in matching call centers with organizations. She was able to match those needs within 24 hours to a select group of very professional, well suited telemarketing firms.”`,
`The new system has helped to improve our operational efficiency by as much as 40 percent. Sales information from each outlet is fed into the central system immediately and our inventory is automatically updated. The resilient IBM infrastructure also ensures we don’t miss out on any sales opportunities.`,
`The integrated POS system allows us to keep track and monitor sales and financial accounts in real-time. We are given such granularity that we can even check if the retail staff at a particular shop is playing solitaire onscreen.`,
`From all of us at Moss Adams we want to say a big Thank You for helping us launch our rebranded website on time and on budget. We’re getting great feedback from internal stakeholders and the external market on the functionality of the website, and how well it aligns with our other brand elements. Laura, Sarah, Christian and myself really enjoyed working with everyone on the Fresh side and thought there was a good balance of your team challenging us while also being flexible.`,
`I wanted to take a moment and say thank you to all at Fresh for your work on Soi Dog's site. The work the team has done is exceptional, one of the best development projects I've witnessed over decades working on business solution architecture, managing dev teams and managing software solution providers. Their work will result in quite literally saving the lives of tens of thousands of dogs and cats. Looking forward to commencing work on Phase 2.`,
`I truly appreciate all the great work you have done for me thus far. You have been highly honest and upfront and we have developed a great working relationship and that is something I sincerely hope to be able to continue doing in the future on other projects.`,
`We are extremely happy here, and we are getting a lot of positive feedback. The clean, simple look is resonating well for us. Nathan did a fabulous job for us, the product icons in particular are amazing – everybody loves them, and they wound up being pretty central to the entire site because on many pages they’re the primary simple “splash,” often in the form of sidebar ads, but also in the excellent diagrams he did and inline in the content. Elisha really went way above and beyond our expectations here. The DMS strategy has worked very well, and he stayed within that paradigm. More than that though, he basically made sure we had everything we wanted/needed in all aspects of the website. I do now shudder to think how lost we’d have been trying to do this without him. The depth of the engineering (often times we enter/update something in one place and have it automatically appear in many others) is appreciated internally. It is my intent to keep us working together going forward.`,
`"I am writing to let you know that we're gratified with Hannah's good performance in the school's recent mock exam writing practice, the SA1 Paper 1 composition, and the Paper 2 comprehension.

Many thanks to her TWC teacher's patient teaching, guidance, and constructive feedback!`,

`“The rooms are neatly tidied and the whole house is well cleaned. The rates are reasonable. It is definitely a good deal.”`,
`“Our assigned nanny is very committed to her job and is a great cook too. A confinement job can be very demanding but she coped well and was always willing to do more. I will recommend anyone who needs a confinement nanny to call DomesticONE.”`,
`“Auntie Li Zhen got rid of my worries, my family and I am really grateful to her. With her help during my confinement, I managed to rest well. Her nutrition-packed home-cooked food also helped me regain my health quickly. My baby boy is in good hands too. Most importantly, my hubby and I do not get any unnecessary stress with our firstborn.”`,
`Hi DomesticONE, thank you your team for the great effort in cleaning my newly renovated house, thumbs up for your team.`,
`Great job by your team of 3 cleaners, they are details and efficient in cleaning my apartment for coming CNY.`,

`The sales team loved the new website and can’t wait to see it launched. Feedback was good at every level of the organization.`,
`Worth noting: the updated filter interactions were a result of the original input from Priya and Nathan and further evolution of the concept that came out of discussions between all of us. Truly, this was a team effort. I’m also really pleased with how the updated filters now function and look forward to rolling this updated UX into our Android and iOS apps!`,
`I want you to know that I really enjoyed working with Fresh Consulting and was very pleased with not only the level of communication, but the deliverables that were given to me. They were able to see that I had a well thought out plan along with a vision for how I wanted the website to look and operate. The mockups and wireframes provided by Fresh Consulting were crucial in conveying my vision to potential investors. I had a very positive experience working with Fresh. I would easily recommend you to others based upon my experience.`,
`"Fresh was really on the ball regarding communication. They were a pleasure to work with. The product they provided works extremely well and meets our needs perfectly. Fresh was very easy to work with and met all of our requirements in a timely manner. We would definitely work with them again. Another: Jesse is doing a fantastic job! We are all incredibly pleased. We are over the moon regarding his wireup diagrams. They really do exceed our expectations!"`,
`I can not tell you how much the hard work you have put in getting us through the finish line with these videos has been appreciated! Don’t know where to begin, but first things first, you have to know that the last IX Suite video you did for us was not only seen, but literally loved by our CEO, CMO and our IX & Cloud SVP (my boss). Trust me when I tell you I made sure they knew who was behind the video.`,
`Thank you for all of your hard work and your help in meeting our deadline. Your responsiveness and patience with all of our changes at the last minute and turning everything around quickly (and in many cases instantly) has not gone unnoticed. The Fresh team has been and is an incredible extension to [our ] team. Thank you for your help.`,
`Brand development is extremely tricky business. How do you connect emotionally with your potential customers when you have their attention for such a fleeting amount of time? With an immense amount of graphic and dynamic creativity, as well as deep understanding of consumer and market preferences in the online space, the Fresh team was able to capture in our logo and marketing materials - everything I really wanted my company’s customers to know about us. It was an amazing experience to watch our vision take on a physical form people could relate to.`,
`Fresh Consulting did a wonderful job exploring our brand promise and culture to ensure that our new website accurately reflects who we are. They came highly recommended by a former colleague of mine who now works with them at another firm. We reviewed several design firms and Fresh was most in sync with what we were trying to accomplish. It felt as if they were embedded in the business rather than an outside consultant. The budget and launch date were both exactly what we agreed upon and their communication was always timely and professional. We look forward to building a long-term relationship.`,
`Fresh has become an invaluable partner to our company. They helped us launch a new service and create a profitable product that continues to add value to our customers. Their combined knowledge of cutting-edge technology and innovative consulting is exactly what we needed to take our company to the next level.`,
`Fresh Consulting has produced two videos for Passport Unlimited and is in the process of producing an additional three. The two videos that Fresh has delivered have been extremely well received. Fresh listened carefully to our needs and crafted videos that were “on message”, fit with our brand and were visually engaging. The process of producing the videos has been smooth. From the initial interview process all the way to the delivery of the final product, Fresh has been very responsive to our feedback and has provided multiple options for us to choose from. I would highly recommend Fresh as a resource for producing high-quality, well executed videos in an economical and efficient manner.`,
`Just wanted to say thanks to the great team at Fresh Consulting that helped us build the Power of Pull fan page. Thanks to everyone – very deeply appreciated by the folks at the Center for the Edge!!`,
`This year, to avoid the hassles of preparing and cooking our family dinner on the 1st day of Lunar New Year, we had decided to order your Stamford Catering’s Joyous Reunion Mini Buffet Set. I wish to commend that the 8 sets of dishes (inclusive of dessert) which came with big warmer bag, ladles, tongs, disposable culteries, plates and cups arrived timely to the requested time and in good order. Initially I was rather worried about the punctuality since it is festive season with heavy traffic and other orders too. Overall, my family and I had thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes and dessert which were tasty and in generous portions.

`Electrician provides electrical services and handle residential, construction, shopfitting, commercial and industrial electrical work, depending on their training and experience. Electrician is highly demanded in Singapore due to the constantly growing construction industry. From installing town or city infrastructure, to common electrical work in new and existing homes, commercial or industrial buildings, electricians and electrical professionals are essential to ensure the electrical wiring and installation is properly performed.`,
`You might think that you would save money by doing the electrical work yourself, rather than hiring an electrician. That’s the main mistake many homeowners make. Most expensive electrical work call outs are the result of botched DIY electrical work. That’s one of the reasons why even experienced building contractors prefer to call electricians to complete electrical work.`,
`It is very important that the public and other stakeholders remain confident in the quality, reliability, and relevance of your company’s financial reporting. It is for this reason that accounting services are very much needed. In addition, the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority or ACRA has started a Financial Reporting Surveillance Programme to ensure quality to prevent poor financial reporting that leads to inaccurate information and/or non-compliance with prescribed accounting standards.`,
`Directors can be very much helped by the accounting services offered by professional accountants, bookkeepers, auditors, management accountants, tax experts, and company secretaries. These professionals can assist directors or management, exercise care, perform with competence, and review with diligence the financial statements that are presented to shareholders and subsequently filed with ACRA and IRAS.`,
`Directors under sections 201(1A), 201(3) and 201(3A) of the Companies Act, are responsible to present at their annual general meeting, financial statements that are prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards issued by the Accounting Standards Council; and provide a true and fair view of the proﬁtability and the financial status of of the company. Furthermore, it is imperative that directors of a company incorporated in Singapore maintain a system of internal accounting controls. Internal control, means the safeguarding of the company’s assets, keeping proper accounting and other records that will lead to the preparation of accurate and fair profit and loss and balance sheet accounts. Hence, directors should carefully choose the accounting services needed to fit their operations. In order to carry out these financial reporting duties, financial literacy is expected of directors as well as the ability to review financial statements. Directors are to have sufficient and up-to-date knowledge of the accounting principles and practices to understand and review effectively the financial statements. Otherwise, directors are strongly encouraged to attend training and/or seek help.`,

`In add1, execution suspends 2 seconds for the first await, and then again another 2 seconds for the second await. The second timer is not created until the first has already fired. In add2,  both timers are created, and then both are awaited. This leads it to resolve in 2 rather than 4 seconds, because the timers are running concurrently. But both of the await calls are still run in series, not in parallel: this is not some automatic application of Promise.all. If you wish to await two or more promises in parallel, you must still use Promise.all.`,
